## Instructions for Gathering Data
Within the `scripts` directory, there are three usable scripts:
    
    - `theworld2.py`
    - `top.py`
    - `bot.py`

To run these, make sure your terminal is in the `scripts` directory as well.

`theworld2.py` ask for the account you are using, the associated api key, the league and rank you want to search, and the server you want to collect the data from.

`top.py` and `bot.py` gather the first and second halves of the data `theworld2.py` does. This way, data for one rank can be collected twice as fast using two api keys. The outputs of these scripts must be put together after running.
